Example of a build test of a library via Github Actions. Here it builds Perl 5 on Windows on WSLv1 (Ubuntu 20.04).

For that I use a Github Action [setup-wsl](https://github.com/Vampire/setup-wsl).

This example is for demonstrating Perl5 build bugs https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18252 and https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18254 (proposal of such a build configuration is in https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18323).
